# London-Crime-Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis on London crime data using SQL, Python and Power BI

### Description

Having lived in different parts of London my entire life, I was curious to analyse crime statistics for the different boroughs in the city. I therefore found two relevant datasets and began exploring the data via SQL queries (see _Analysis & PBI Query.sql_ file). After investigating and cleaning the data, I queried what I needed into Power BI to further explore and visualise trends. Once in Power BI, I had to add an extra column for tagging London boroughs which I did with a small Python script (see _Ldn_Borough_Tagging.py_ file). I then built my interactive dashboard to help visualise which boroughs were safest / most dangerous and which crime types were mostly being perpetrated. 

This Power BI dashboard can be found in the _London_Crime_Dashboard.pdf_ file above and is also showcased in the following gif:




Original data source can be found on Kaggle here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/london-police-records. I then uploaded this data to an Azure SQL Database to query and pull into Power BI.
